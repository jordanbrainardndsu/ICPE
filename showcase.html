<p class="w3-left-align w3-medium"><strong>Project Desciption</strong><br>
	Ericsson is a global leader in delivering Information and Communication Technology (ICT) solutions. In fact, forty percent of the world's mobile traffic is carried over Ericsson networks. This semester's project for Ericsson was to develop a mobile application that can send an android ping to a database. Once that ping is in the server, the web interface that we created will communicate with the web server we setup to display real-time data circles that entail cellular network information.</p>

<p class="w3-left-align w3-medium"><strong>Project Desciption</strong><br>
	The Internet of Things is a technology that is being pioneered by many businesses and organizations. To understand the feasibility of this new field, Inwerken had tasked us to build a prototype workflow demonstrating the connection of external sensor data being parsed and sent to the cloud.</p>
<p>Our solution consisted of a provided gateway sensor device connecting to the HANA Cloud database through several pre-exsisting frameworks. Using the Node-RED JavaScript framework, which is a programming tool for connecting the Internet of Things together, we are parsing different types of test data (like humidity and brightness), packaging it into a json string, and sending it to the HANA Cloud.</p>
<p> The HANA Cloud toolset allows us to receive this data through a Node-RED http post and populates a table within the Internet of Things Message Management Service. Once it is in the HANA Cloud, any other activated HANA services are allowed to access it. Using a SAP U15 application, we are able to display and manipulate this data, as well as communicate directly back to these sensors connected to the gateway device. This makes commands like manual LED changes possible, starting from the HANA Cloud front end all the way to the gateway device giving LED change commands.</p>

	Team of two ECE students from Texas A&amp;M working with a sponsor at UNSW, Australia, on a system that estimates crowds in a room as well as incoming and outgoing traffic in order to do crowd control as well as market reach calculations. Phone app summarizes and enables user to visualize all the information.</p>

	<p class="w3-left-align w3-large"><strong><u>UNSW, Australia working with Texas A&M University, United States</u></strong><br>
	Team of two ECE students from UNSW working with a sponsor at Texas A&amp;M University, USA, developing  a platform that will track its user’s movements and follow them around busy areas like airports, train stations, bus stations etc. plus alert the user if the connection is lost. The platform can handle weights of up to 10Kg, which is the equivalent of airplane carry-on luggage.</p>

	<p class="w3-left-align w3-large"><strong><u>Linkoping University and the University of Colorado-Colorado Springs</u></strong><br>
	UCCS has two teams working on two different projects supporting Linkoping’s Student Formula car. One team is developing a solution that should change the angle of attack of the rear wing during a race. The second team is developing a new lightweight solution for the pedal box.</p>

	<p class="w3-left-align w3-large"><strong><u>North Dakota State University working for Inwerken – Hannover, Germany (via Hochshule-Hannover – University of Applied Sciences and Arts)</u></strong><br>
	NDSU students worked with Inwerken, an SAP business software consulting company to make an Internet of Things (IoT) solution to easily obtain and display sensor data in the cloud. Their solution for this uses a TI-SensorTag CC2650 sensor to capture data and send it to a BananaPro microcomputer via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The data is preprocessed on the BananaPro device locally and then pushed to the SAP HANA Cloud via the internet with simple URL calls. Using SAP’s UI5 platform, they implemented a display dashboard to visualize the data, giving the client greater control and awareness over their product and processes.</p>

	<p class="w3-left-align w3-large"><strong><u>North Dakota State University working for the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute, Linkoping, Sweden (via Linkoping University)</u></strong><br>
	The project developed a web application used to monitor climate data coming from an HPC. It uses a php back end with an Angular JS front end. The information displayed includes time stamps of previous 5 updates, time since previous updates (displayed as a dynamic counter), most recent model status (including previous 4 status), and a time series charts to display scalar data. Another feature includes the ability to search and display multiple files. Our project is compatible with a variety of devices including tablet and mobile.</p>

	<p class="w3-left-align w3-large"><strong><u>North Dakota State University working with Data61 – Australia (via Deakin University)</u></strong><br>
	This project focuses on manipulating various data sets without having to send the data over the internet to be processed. The way it was achieved was by writing a backend service that takes the data mappings from the data sets the user wants to manipulate along with the transformations they want to perform on the data sets. After the service receives all this data it generates a JavaScript file that is passed back to the front end where the front end uses it to perform the transformation on the data sets. This process allows the user to achieve their goal of manipulating data sets without sending all the data over the internet and allows users to perform these manipulations from anywhere they have internet access.</p>

	<p class="w3-left-align w3-large"><strong><u>Western Sydney University, Australia, working with Sparrow Marine, Savannah, Georgia, United States</u></strong><br>
	A team of information communication technology students developed a web-based system to maintain regulatory details of vessels. The tool simplifies the query process, allowing the marine experts to understand regulations that are applicable to different states.</p>

	<p class="w3-left-align w3-large"><strong><u>University of Applied Sciences and Arts Hannover, Germany, working with National Information Solutions Cooperative, United States (via North Dakota State University)</u></strong><br>
	A team of computer science students developed an iOS app for a utility bill pay application that enabled customers to visualize utility costs and bill payment for their facilities on iPhone and iPad.</p>

	<p class="w3-left-align w3-large"><strong><u>University of Illinois Urbana/Champaign, United States and Universidad del Norte, Colombia working with Grain Systems, Inc., United States</u></strong><br>
	A team of students improved the design of existing grain handling hardware. They replaced existing mechanisms with higher quality parts that cost less than installing a new system.</p>
